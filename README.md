What this Website Does:
-----------------------

When you run entertainment.py, it opens a file called fresh_tomatoes.html in your web browser. 

NOTE: On your computer, if you have associated a .hmtl file with an editor application, this file will be opened in that editor application. To get the expected behavior, please associate .html file to be opened by a web browser.

The website shows six of favorite movies: their poster and their title. If you click on the poster image, another window opens up and shows you the movie's trailer.

Enjoy the trailers!
